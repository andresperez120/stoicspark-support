    <h1>Privacy Policy for StoicSpark</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 11, 2025</p>
    
    <p>Andres Perez ("we," "us," or "our") operates the StoicSpark mobile application (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>To provide core features of the Service, especially the accountability partner system, we need to collect a small amount of information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account to use the partner features, we store a unique User ID and the username you provide. We do not require or collect your real name or email address.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> To send you notifications about partner invites and check-ins, we securely collect and store your Apple Push Notification service (APNs) device token.</li>
        <li><strong>Interaction Data:</strong> We store data related to your use of the partner features, such as partnership connections, invitations, and check-in history, to power the streak and accountability features.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide, maintain, and improve the Service.</li>
        <li>To enable social features, such as sending and receiving partner invites using your username.</li>
        <li>To send you push notifications related to partner activity, which are essential for the feature to work.</li>
        <li>To calculate and display your accountability streak with your partner.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use Supabase as our backend service provider. Supabase provides the database, authentication, and server infrastructure needed to power the online features of StoicSpark. All data we collect is stored securely on Supabase servers. You can view their privacy policy <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy">here</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>To provide and manage premium features, we use Apple's in-app purchase framework. All purchase information is handled securely by Apple, and we only receive an anonymous confirmation of your purchase status to unlock features within the app. We do not have access to your Apple ID, payment information, or any other personal data related to your transactions.</p>

    <h2>5. Device Permissions</h2>
    <p><strong>Photo Library:</strong> The app may require permission to access your photo library for the sole purpose of saving wallpapers or other generated content to your device. The app does not read, upload, or collect any of your existing photos or videos.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>The security of your data is important to us. We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access. However, no electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.</p>
