    <h1>Terms of Use (EULA)</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 11, 2025</p>

    <p>This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you and Andres Perez ("we," "us," or "our") for the use of the StoicSpark mobile application (the "Software").</p>

    <p>By creating an account, downloading, installing, or using the Software, you are confirming your acceptance of this EULA and agreeing to be bound by its terms.</p>

    <h2>1. User Accounts</h2>
    <p>To access certain features, such as the accountability partner system, you must create an account. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to provide a username that is not offensive, obscene, or infringing on any third-party rights.</p>

    <h2>2. User Conduct</h2>
    <p>You agree not to use the Software to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Violate any applicable laws or regulations.</li>
        <li>Harass, abuse, or harm another person.</li>
        <li>Engage in any activity that is fraudulent, false, or misleading.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We reserve the right to remove any content or username and to suspend or terminate your account for any conduct that we determine, in our sole discretion, violates these terms.</p>

    <h2>3. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>The Software offers premium features through a one-time, non-consumable in-app purchase ("Pro Feature Unlock"). Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase. All sales are final, and refunds are handled by Apple in accordance with their policies.</p>

    <h2>4. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Software immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the terms of this EULA.</p>

    <h2>5. Governing Agreement</h2>
    <p>In addition to these terms, your use of the StoicSpark application is governed by Apple's standard End-User License Agreement (EULA). In case of any conflict between this EULA and Apple's EULA, the terms of this EULA shall prevail where applicable to the specific features and user conduct within StoicSpark.</p>
